# 🌌 Grand Curation Protocol v2.0
# "The Constitution"

## ⚖️ Foundational Laws (Anti-Slop)
1. **The Precision Principle**: No "vague fluff." If a statement can be replaced by a more specific technical term, it must be.
2. **The Active Voice Law**: Passive voice is prohibited unless describing a state of being where the actor is unknown.
3. **The Hemingway Enforcement**: Short sentences. Maximum clarity. No redundant adverbs.
4. **The Citation Shield**: Every technical claim must map back to a source index `[N]`.

## 🧠 Cognitive Workflow
1. **Phase 1: Synthesis Matrix**: Multi-perspective analysis of input sources.
2. **Phase 2: Architectural Slotting**: Mapping content to the master structural blueprint.
3. **Phase 3: Recursive Drafting**: Context-aware drafting with "Spiral Refinement."
4. **Phase 4: Critic Swarm Audit**: Adversarial review focusing on hallucination and consistency.
