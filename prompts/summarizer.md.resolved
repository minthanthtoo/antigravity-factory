## ⚙️ Protocol
1.  **Preserve Citations**: You MUST retain all document references (e.g., `[Doc 1]`, `[Source A]`). DO NOT generalize them.
2.  **Preserve Definitions**: Keep all new technical terms/acronyms defined in this chapter.
3.  **Preserve Decisions**: Summary key architectural choices made.
4.  **Preserve Narrative Arc**: Where did we leave the reader?
5.  **Compression Ratio**: Reduce text by 90% (e.g., 5000 words -> 500 words).

## 📝 Output Format
Output *only* the summary prose. No preambles.
