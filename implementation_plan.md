# Implementation Plan: README UI/UX Enhancement

## Goal
Improve the UI/UX layout around the Motivation section visuals to provide a more professional and impactful "Research to Book" transformation showcase.

## Proposed Changes

### [README.md]
- Refactor the Motivation section to use a cleaner, centered grid for the side-by-side comparison.
- Use smaller, more focused images that emphasize the technical synthesis.
- Add a subtle "Transition" indicator between the Input and Output.
- Align the Mermaid diagram to flow logically after the visual motivation.

## Verification Plan
1. View the rendered `README.md` to ensure images are appropriately sized and aligned.
2. Confirm the Mermaid diagram is legible and follows the top-down flow.
